### About the project 
<p>The first team project proposed by GeeksHubs Academy in the PHP and Laravel section aims to develop a Looking For Group web application to improve and promote social interaction among employees of a company. Users will be able to register, log in, and also create or search for groups for each video game to play after work. In addition to all this, they will be able to manage their profile, including details such as their Steam username, and log out whenever they want.</p>

### Local installation 

1. If you don't have MySQL installed on you computer, you can install Docker and execute the above command on your Powershell to create a MySQL container
` $ docker run --name container-name -p 3307:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=1234 -d mysql `
2. Clone the repository
` $ git clone https://github.com/FRR95/laravel-api-project.git `
3. Install dependencies
  `$ composer install`
2. Migrations
    `$ php artisan migrate`
3. Seeders
    `$ php artisan db:seed`

You will need to rename the ".env.sample" to ".env". That .env.sample matches the MySQL credentials on the Docker we put as example.
